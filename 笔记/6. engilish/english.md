Chinese characters `originated from` simple descriptions of natural `scenes` `in ancient times`, such as trees, rivers, mountains, and people. These descriptions were `actually` the germ of hieroglyphics. Oracles are ancient characters carved on turtle shells and animal bones. The `creation and application` of Chinese characters `played an important role in` the development of `Chinese civilization`. Chinese characters have also had a `profound impact` on the development of world civilization. For example, the characters of Japan, Korea and other countries were created `on the basis of` Chinese characters
